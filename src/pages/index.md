An electrical engineer is someone who applies the physics and mathematics of electricity, electromagnetism and electronics to design and develop new electrical equipment and systems, to solve problems and to test equipment. The emergence of the modern age is noted by the introduction of electricity to homes, businesses and industry, all of which were made possible by electrical engineers.

>Electrical science has revealed to us the true nature of light, has provided us with innumerable appliances and instruments of precision, and has thereby vastly added to the exactness of our knowledge. Nikola Tesla. <cite>Neil Gaiman</cite>

Electrical engineers work on a variety of projects, such as computers, robots, cell phones, cards, radars, navigation systems, wiring and lighting in buildings and other kinds of electrical systems. More and more, electrical engineers are relying on computer-aided design (CAD) systems for the creation of schematics and to lay out circuits, and they use computers to simulate how electrical devices and systems will function.
